## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw it or Lose it, which is currently only available on Android.


## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I the recommendations part of the document is well written and gives well thought out recommendations based on the software requirements of the client.  


## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found that having a UML diagram was very helpful when developing the code. Having a layout for classes and how they relate to others is an amazing resource to have when writing code for the application.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part to revise, I would choose the design constrains section. I believe that the section would benefit from a little more clarity on constraints concerning the server side of the application. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to tailor the software design to best fit the users’ needs while also keeping in mind possible upgrade paths for future development. This is important to ensure you deliver high quality software that will satisfy the customer. 

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I will be using UML diagrams more in the future because I think they are a great tool for prototyping class design and giving a general idea of how the software should interact with each other. Additionally, I think keeping in mind possible future expansion will be important to the longevity and maintainability of our applications.
